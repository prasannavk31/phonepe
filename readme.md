# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration

# Problem Statement:

The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.

# Approach:

* Data extraction: Cloning the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and store it in a suitable format such as CSV or JSON.

* Data transformation: Using a scripting language such as Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This may include cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

* Database insertion: Use the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to a MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.

* Dashboard creation: Using the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map functions can be used to display the data on a map and Streamlit can be used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

* Data retrieval: Using the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe and Using the data in the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.
